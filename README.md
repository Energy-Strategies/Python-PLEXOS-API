A repository of simple Python examples for use with the PLEXOS API

# PLEXOS® Integrated Energy Model
PLEXOS® Integrated Energy Model (PLEXOS) is tried-and-true simulation software that uses state-of-the-art
mathematical optimisation combined with the latest data handling and visualisation and distributed computing 
methods, to provide a high-performance, robust simulation system for electric power, water and gas that is 
leading edge yet open and transparent. PLEXOS meets the demands of energy market participants, system planners,
investors, regulators, consultants and analysts alike with a comprehensive range of features seamlessly integrating
electric, water, gas and heat production, transportation and demand over simulated timeframes from minutes to 10’s 
of years, all delivered through a common simulation engine with easy-to-use interface and integrated data platform. 
PLEXOS is the fastest and most sophisticated software available today, and also the most cost-effective.

# PLEXOS Licensing
PLEXOS® licensing is *not* included with the license for these examples. These scripts are therefore only useful to
those with current PLEXOS licensing. Furthermore, these scripts are *NOT* a supported part of the PLEXOS software.
They are only illustrative of uses that could be made of the PLEXOS API by PLEXOS licensees.

# Development Environment
The authors are primarily using Anaconda Python version 3.6.x along with the PyDotNet repository, along with PLEXOS Desktop 7.5R05. 
As of this writing, PyDotNet is not available for Python 3.7.x or above.
Also .NET Framework SDK 4.6.2 or higher is needed. However, you would have to install this to use PLEXOS.
